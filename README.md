The goal of `pray` is to display ASCII art of objects for prayer in the R console. This package currently includes a function to display a Shinto shrine as ASCII art, providing a unique and visually interesting way to bring symbolic representations to the console.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `pray` from [GitHub](https://github.com/YutoriSpine/pray) with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("YutoriSpine/pray")


```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```r
library(pray)

# Display the Shinto shrine ASCII art in the console
shinto()

```
